# Contributing to Awesome Bittensor

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ‚ù§Ô∏è

All types of contributions are encouraged and valued. Please make sure to read the relevant section before making your contribution. It will make it a lot easier for me as the maintainer and smooth out the experience for all involved. The community looks forward to your contributions. üéâ

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Awesome Bittensor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to contact@mcjkula.com.

## I Have a Question

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/learnbittensor/awesome-bittensor/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, I recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/learnbittensor/awesome-bittensor/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and other information depending on what seems relevant.

I will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

## Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Awesome Bittensor, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help me and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://github.com/opentensor/awesome-bittensor) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/learnbittensor/awesome-bittensor/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince me of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that I want features that will be useful to the majority of users and not just a small subset.

### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/learnbittensor/awesome-bittensor/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Awesome Bittensor users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.
